This repo is meant to show, with dates and platform screenshots, how the server shifted over time (and when LATAM actually starts showing up), plus when Rich Legacy was already established relative to “official” LATAM/US pushes.

If you want to verify the timeline for yourself, view it in this order:
Start with the “friends / added” timeline
The list is sorted by date added as friend (earliest → latest).

The easiest way to see the shift is to scroll until you hit the first clump of Latin hosts (Spanish/Portuguese names, LATAM bios, flags, etc.).

Then look at the gap between that first LATAM clump and the earlier adds (which are primarily Arab / Philippines era).
Note: “30 days ago” on profiles is just “last online,” not when they joined — it’s useful for activity context, not for the join timeline.

What you’re looking for:

When LATAM starts appearing at all
How long the server existed before that shift becomes visible through friend-add chronology

Use Jozi as the “anchor” profile
Go straight to Jozi Rodrigues.
Verify the hard fields: Nationality: Brazil and Registration Time: 2024/5/8.
From there, follow how additional LATAM connections appear after that point.

What you’re looking for:
A concrete early LATAM proof-point (Brazil) with a join date you can’t hand-wave away
Cross-check against the “official expansion” messaging

Open Nancy’s post that explicitly promotes US & LATAM recruitment and frames it as an “official” push.

Treat that as the platform’s public-facing “we’re expanding” moment, and compare it to the timeline evidence in the friend-add list and early LATAM profiles.

What you’re looking for:
Whether LATAM recruitment is happening organically in user networks before it becomes loudly “official” in promo posts
Review the family ecosystem comparisons (who was actually active + established)

When you look at other families and contemporaries:
You’ll see repeating tags like 🌶️ and 🪄 across multiple profiles. Track how often those show up and where they sit in the timeline.

Notice how many “peer” families appear shuttered (only emojis left, no active family structure attached).

It’s not until Secrets by Miss (the group tied to a shared anniversary event and one of the earliest official agency PK battles) that you consistently find a comparable family still operating.

What you’re looking for:
Which groups were “real” and sustained vs. which ones disappeared

How close anyone actually was to Rich Legacy in continuity and structure

Check the salas (this is the platform-state proof)

Open the sala screenshots and compare:
Rich Legacy sala: confirm the room ID and that the room intro language is already Spanish-facing (welcome message, onboarding tone, etc.).

SUGO LATAM OFICIAL sala: confirm its ID and presence as an “official LATAM” room.

The key comparison:
The “official LATAM” sala showing up with an ID/timeline that’s after Rich Legacy’s sala already exists and is functioning.

What you’re looking for:
Which room was established first (not by claims, but by what the app itself shows)
Finish with the Moments language shift (June → August)

This is the “behavioral timeline” that matches the platform expansion:

By June, the posts begin appearing in multiple languages, including translations and bilingual outreach.

There are posts offering bonuses for bilingual hosts (Spanish + English), which lines up with the period where the platform starts pushing Spanish users harder.

By August, the feed becomes mostly Spanish, showing the shift isn’t theoretical — it’s visible in public posting behavior.

What you’re looking for:
A clean language transition over time that matches the expansion pattern (not a sudden “after the fact” rewrite)
